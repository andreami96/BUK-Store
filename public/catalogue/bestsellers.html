                        Marcus Goldman, author and protégé of the famous author Harry Quebert, is the narrator of this book. We follow him from having had a very successful debut novel, to having writers block, to writing another bestseller about a murder that happened thirty three years ago and where the main suspect is none other that his friend and mentor Harry Quebert. What is interesting is that the chapters go backwards, from chapter thirty one to one which reflects how the story unfolds, gradually going backwards to find out what really happened to Nola Kellergan.
