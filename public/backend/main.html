                    This page is the available documentation for the BUK Store Backend application.
                    Here you can find the main information concerning the development of the Backend and the
                    development of the Database used inside the application.
                    <br>
                    This document is structured into 4 more section:
                </p>

                    In the first section you will find the main information about <i>MiChi-Studios</i> team and how they
                    split their work in order to be able to complete this project. Moreover here you can find a contact
                    address for each team member

                <p>
                    In the second section are reported the links related to each required deliverable, concerning the

                    <br>
                    Indeed in this section you will find the links for the download of
                    the <b>YAML</b> specification file, the link to the <b>Swagger<i>UI</i></b> online page in order
                    to test the BUK Store <i>API</i>, a link used to download our application in a convenient <i>ZIP</i>

                <p>
                    In the third section of this document you will find a detailed report of each part of our application.
                    Here there is a section related to our web architecture, and here you can find how we have decided to
                    divide our application and how each component interacts with the others.
                    <br>
                    Then there is a part devoted to the explanation of the Database of our application, so how
                    we have developed our relationship inside a real database, what are the entities we have used and
                    how these entities are mapped into the <i>OpenAPI</i> models
                    <br>
                    This section continues with a part on the tools we have used during the development phase of the
                    BUK Store application, what kind of languages and frameworks we have adopted in our web app.
                    <br>
                    Finally this part ends with a discussion on our decision, and how the choices we have made adhere to
                    the <i>OpenAPI</i> specification we have written, how we have partitioned the application data and
                    the static assets and how we have managed the session of the user inside the web application
                </p>

                    The BUK Store application was developed during the Hypermedia Application (Web and Multimedia) course
                    of the Politecnico di Milano. The main purpose of this application is to develop a web application
                    for an online book store and its multimedia content about books and authors. In particular the web
                    application should handle 3 main entities: Books, Authors and Events. Each book can be written by
                    different authors, and of course each author has probably written more than one book.
                    There are also events during which a book is presented.
                    <br>
                    So the user should be able to surf the BUK Store application, finding the useful information about each
                    book, event or author, but also he or she should be able to reserve some books and to see his/hers
                    purchases.

                    The BUK Store Web Application is divided into the common Client-Server pattern. The client is represented
                    by the user's web browser, and for that the frontend part of the application is written with
                    HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in this way the most common browsers can handle and render properly the
                    frontend of this application.
                    <br>
                    Focusing on the Server, it is developed using the famous Node.js framework and it is deployed on
                    a Heroku machine

                    Our teams is composed by 3 members, and we have decide to split, in general, the amount of work into
                    two main parts: Frontend development and Backend development.
                    <br>
                    First of all, in order to properly split our work, we have chosen to devote some times to think and
                    design the <i>REST</i> API of our application all together, in order to have a common reference point.
                    Then, before starting to work on both the frontend and the backend, we also have decided to firstly
                    define the user experience of the BUK Store application, spending some times in designing the interfaces
                    <br>
                    At this point we was ready to start, and since, thanks to Node.js, the Server development is become
                    easier during the years, we have decide to initially split our group in this way:
                </p>

                <ul class="dashed">
                    <li>1 person is in charge of the backend development: <i>Luca Napoletano</i></li>
                    <li>2 people are in charge of the frontend development: <i>Andrea Miotto & Claudio Montantari</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    With this division in mind, we have started to work both on the frontend and on the backend, and this was
                    possible thanks to development of the API before starting to coding.
                    <br>
                    As soon as the backend development was finished, all the team members started to work on the frontend
                    speeding up the implementation of the UI/UX.
                    <br>
                    To understand more deeply the division of our work, below is reported a table in which is written
                    what was done by each team member
