                    This page is the available documentation for the BUK Store Backend application.
                    Here you can find the main information concerning the development of the Backend and the
                    development of the Database used inside the application.
                    <br>
                    This document is structured into 4 more section:
                </p>
                <div class="row justify-content-center">

                <p>
                    In the first section you will find the main information about <i>MiChi-Studios</i> team and how they
                    split their work in order to be able to complete this project. Moreover here you can find a contact
                    address for each team member
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second section are reported the links related to each required deliverable, concerning the
                    Backend part of this project.
                    <br>
                    Indeed in this section you will find the links for the download of
                    the <b>YAML</b> specification file, the link to the <b>Swagger<i>UI</i></b> online page in order
                    to test the BUK Store <i>API</i>, a link used to download our application in a convenient <i>ZIP</i>
                    file and finally you will find the link of the <i>MiChi-Studios</i> GitHub Repository
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the third section of this document you will find a detailed report of each part of our application.
                    Here there is a section related to our web architecture, and here you can find how we have decided to
                    divide our application and how each component interacts with the others.
                    <br>
                    Then there is a part devoted to the explanation of the Database of our application, so how
                    we have developed our relationship inside a real database, what are the entities we have used and
                    how these entities are mapped into the <i>OpenAPI</i> models
                    <br>
                    This section continues with a part on the tools we have used during the development phase of the
                    BUK Store application, what kind of languages and frameworks we have adopted in our web app.
                    <br>
                    Finally this part ends with a discussion on our decision, and how the choices we have made adhere to
                    the <i>OpenAPI</i> specification we have written, how we have partitioned the application data and
                    the static assets and how we have managed the session of the user inside the web application
                </p>

                The BUK Store application was developed during the Hypermedia Application (Web and Multimedia) course
                of the Politecnico di Milano. The main purpose of this application is to develop a web application
                for an online book store and its multimedia content about books and authors. In particular the web
                application should handle 3 main entities: Books, Authors and Events. Each book can be written by
                different authors, and of course each author has probably written more than one book.
                There are also events during which a book is presented.
                <br>
                So the user should be able to surf the BUK Store application, finding the useful information about each
                book, event or author, but also he or she should be able to reserve some books and to see his/hers
                purchases.

                The BUK Store Web Application is divided into the common Client-Server pattern. The client is represented
                by the user's web browser, and for that the frontend part of the application is written with
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in this way the most common browsers can handle and render properly the
                frontend of this application.

                <br>
                Focusing on the Server, it is developed using the famous Node.js framework and it is deployed on
                a Heroku machine.
                <div class="row justify-content-center">

                <br>
                The Server is divided into 4 main component, which are in charge of fulfill a specific function:
                <br><br>

                <br>
                As you can notice from the above diagram, the four part are the model, the controller, the route
                handler and a static part, used to serve the HTML, CSS or JavaScript files.

                This is the core part of the data of BUK Store application. This module is in charge of creating the
                entire structure of the Database, both each one of the tables (which they will be described later
                in this document) and also the relationship between them.
                In the Model package of the application you can find various folders, each one contains the files
                which tells how the tables should be stored inside the PostgreSQL database.
                <br>
                Then you can find a special file called <kbd>sequelize.js</kbd>, which is the main entry point of all
                the Model. Each table is actually created in this file, and each relation is mapped here, thanks to the
                <i>Sequelize</i> instructions <kbd>table.belongsTo</kbd> or <kbd>table.belongsToMany</kbd>. This
                code is actually executed before the Server starts up, in this way it is assured that the Database is
                created before the application starts.

                the <i>REST API</i> specification, querying the Database to obtain results and to pack them into
                nice objects used to be sent to the client.
                <br>
                This module is divided into various categories, one for each request the Server can handle. In this
                files you will find 2 main types code, one used to actually query the Database to retrieve the information
                requested, and another one used to pack this data into JSON objects, which will be sent to the client
                by the Route Handler.
                <br>
                The controller is also responsible to check the parameters of the client's requests, in order to avoid
                some unpleasant behaviours, and is also responsible to check if the user is logged in or not (done
                inside the <kbd>checkAuthMiddleware</kbd> function), in order to properly handle the user's session,
                the user's cart and the user's books reservation

                This component is made thanks to the Express Framework, part of the Node.js suite. This part of the
                web application is the entry point for all the requests which come to the server.
                <br>
                The route handler component is implemented inside the <i>Route</i> package, which contains the entire
                set of function used to handle the endpoints of the API. All this function are the common ones
                used in the express environment:
                <br>
                <kbd>
                    router.get('/', function(req, res, next) { ...code... });
                </kbd>
                <br>
                The Route Handler component, for the sake of maintainability, is splitted into 2 main javascript file,
                the <kbd>staticRouter.js</kbd> and the <kbd>apiRouter.js</kbd>, which are used to handle, respectively,
                the static pages and the API endpoints.
                More specifically, the Static Router is used to handle different URLs, and it only sends to the client
                the requested page, without any kind of rendering; while the API Router is used to fulfill the endpoints
                requests, giving back to the client the JSON object with the data requested.
                <br>
                To be more sure that no pages can be rendered from the server, actually there isn't any kind of
                component installed in our application which can be render a page (I.E. the <i>EJS</i> view engine),
                so the Server is only able either to retrieve static pages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript client side) or
                to construct JSON objects to be sent to the client through the API endpoints

                The whole architecture fulfill the <i>REST</i> API specification, indeed, as you can see from the
                <i>SwaggerUI</i> page, the only accepted request are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. All the request made
                to the server will be responded by a JSON object (or an array of JSON objects), which contains
                either the data requested or an error message, which specifies the HTTP error code and a description
                of the occurred error. Each response gives one of the following HTTP code:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>200</b>: The request is successful, and the Server return a proper object
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>201</b>: The request is successful, and a new User is created inside the DB. You should
                        received a mail by the Server with a activation link for that account
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>400</b>: The request isn't well written. Probably the parameters you have given either in the
                        query part or in the body part aren't properly written, or maybe there is a required parameter
                        which is actually missing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>401</b>: This endpoint belongs to the protected one, so it is required the login before accessing
                        this endpoint. If you receive this error, it means that either the login isn't successful or you
                        are trying to access to a private endpoint without a valid session token
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>404</b>: The path specified in the URL doesn't exists
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>409</b>: There is a conflict inside the Database. This happens when you are trying to
                        register a user which has the same email address of another user already registered in the
                        application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>500</b>: The Server has encountered an error during the processing of your request
                    </li>
                </ul>
                To adhere more to the <i>REST API</i> specification, the HTTP verbs used in the BUK Store application
                have the usual "REST" meanings:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>GET</b>: Request used to retrieve information from the Database, it is a Safe call (so it
                    doesn't change the Data status) and it preserves the Idempotency property (so applied two times
                    consequently retrieves the same result)</li>
                    <li><b>POST</b>: Request used to create a new Datum inside the Database. In the BUK web app is used
                    to create new user, to add a new product to the user's cart or to create a reservation for the current
                    user. It isn't a safe call, since it changes the status of the DB, and of course it isn't idempontent,
                    because two consequently call changes two times the status of the Database</li>
                    <li><b>PUT</b>: Request used to change and update a Datum inside the Database. In our application, is
                    used only to change a book inside the user's cart, in order to be able to change the quantity of
                    desired books (this request isn't able to delete a book from the cart). The PUT request isn't a
                    Safe call, since its purpose is to update a resource, but it is idempotent, since applied two times,
                    of course with the same parameters, it update the same resource with the same values</li>
                    <li><b>DELETE</b>: Request used to delete and a resource from the Database. In the app is used only
                    when a user wants to delete a book inside his/hers cart. Of course this isn't a Safe call, as you
                    can imagine, but it preserves the Idempotency property, since apply two times the DELETE to the same
                    object doesn't delete the object twice, obviously</li>
                </ul>
                To have a more faithful implementation of the <i>REST</i> APIs, we have decided also to keep, as much
                as possible, the same name convention used in the <i>REST</i> specification, so a great number of endpoints
                follows the usual convention, such as <kbd>/api/v1/books</kbd> which retrieves all the books inside the
                database, or <kbd>/api/v1/authors/1/books</kbd>, which is used to retrieve the books written by the author
                with identifier 1. But, sometimes, some other endpoints are introduced, to be more specific, for instance
                there is the <kbd>/api/v1/me</kbd> endpoint used to retrieve the information about the the user which is
                actually logged in, or the <kbd>api/v1/me/cart</kbd>, which doesn't follow the usual name convention
                (in that case it should be carts, plural, not singular), but this decision was taken since each user
                as only one cart, so the singular emphasizes this concept.
                <br>
                Finally, the whole API system is designed in order to make the Server able to handle all the possible
                requests that a user can do, with the minimum amount of endpoints and the minimum amount of bandwidth
                wasting, so, for instance, when the books are requested, since the book object is quite large, and inside
                the database there can be hundreds of them, the decision made was to create the JSON object with the minimum
                amount of information (so, in this case, only the title and the ISBN), and to shift the responsibility of
                composing a bigger object to the more soecific endpoint <kbd>/api/v1/book/{ISBN}</kbd>, which is called
                only when all the book's information are required.

                The above diagram is an Entity Relationship (for the sake of brevity ER) Diagram, used to describe more
                deeply the Database of the BUK application.
                Diving into this diagram, they can be found various main entities (with a rectangular shape),
                such as the Book, the Event, the Author or the User, and various relations (with a diamond shape)
                between this entities, like the Cart, the Reservation or the WrittenBy.Depending on the actual type
                of relation (if it is 1:1 or 1:N or N:N), some of them will be deployed as a real table, while others
                will be implemented simply adding a reference inside other tables, already present. To give you an idea,
                for instance the Cart relation, since it is a relation between Book and User of type N:N, is implemented
                as a real table inside the Database, while the relation Has between Review and Book, which maps
                N different reviews with only 1 book, will be implemented adding a reference to the ISBN of the book inside
                the Review table.
                <br>
                To have a more depth knowledge about how this ER Diagram is actually implemented in the Database, after this
                paragraph will be reported the real structure of each table inside the Database.

                    Our teams is composed by 3 members, and we have decide to split, in general, the amount of work into
                    two main parts: Frontend development and Backend development.
                    <br>
                    First of all, in order to properly split our work, we have chosen to devote some times to think and
                    design the <i>REST</i> API of our application all together, in order to have a common reference point.
                    Then, before starting to work on both the frontend and the backend, we also have decided to firstly
                    define the user experience of the BUK Store application, spending some times in designing the interfaces
                    <br>
                    At this point we was ready to start, and since, thanks to Node.js, the Server development is become
                    easier during the years, we have decide to initially split our group in this way:
                </p>

                <ul class="dashed">
                    <li>1 person is in charge of the backend development: <i>Luca Napoletano</i></li>
                    <li>2 people are in charge of the frontend development: <i>Andrea Miotto & Claudio Montantari</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    With this division in mind, we have started to work both on the frontend and on the backend, and this was
                    possible thanks to development of the API before starting to coding.
                    <br>
                    As soon as the backend development was finished, all the team members started to work on the frontend
                    speeding up the implementation of the UI/UX.
                    <br>
                    To understand more deeply the division of our work, below is reported a table in which is written
                    what was done by each team member
